Gila was named after the Gila Apache tribe, in order to parody the Apache Web Server.

This project was made in Spring 2016 as a final project for CS0449 at Pitt.

I made specific note that security was not in mind when writing this program, as it was never to actually be used as a standing web server. At the time of submitting this project, I was well aware of a considerable amount of security flaws. Unfortunately, securing this software was something I didn't have time for. (It was due during finals week - security was not something we were to be concerned about - we were not instructed to make a secure web server, just something that works)

The goal of this project was to simply serve an HTML webpage to the user if requested. The server was made to be run on a Linux or Unix-based system.
