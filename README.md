Gila was named after the Gila Apache tribe, in order to parody the Apache Web Server.

This project was made in Spring 2016 as a final project for CS0449 at Pitt.

I made specific note that security was not in mind when writing this program, as it was never to actually be used as a standing web server. At the time of submitting this project, I was well aware of a considerable amount of security flaws. Unfortunately, securing this software was just something I didn't have time for. (It was due during finals week - security was not something we were not instructed to make a reasonably secure web server, just something that works)

I was more concerned about basic funcionality and serving web pages to the user. The server was made to be run on a Linux or Unix-based system.
